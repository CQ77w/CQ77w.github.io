### Who am I?

I’m introspective, and a bit scared of people, but still curious about them.

### My Home  
### 我的家  

I live in a small place that I’ve made cozy. There’s a soft carpet I bought from Ikea, some books (science, philosophy, comics), and a Nintendo Switch. The kitchen has a fridge, microwave, and an induction stove, but I don’t even have dishes yet.  

我住在一个不大的地方，我把它布置得很舒服。有一块我从宜家买来的柔软地毯，一些书（科学、哲学、漫画），还有一台任天堂 Switch。厨房里有冰箱、微波炉和电磁炉，但目前连碗盘都没有。  

I like sitting on the carpet—it’s so soft you could even sleep on it. 

我喜欢坐在地毯上——它软到可以直接睡上去。

### Reflection  
### 反思  

I used to think I was special, the center of the world. Later, I felt like nothing, just one of 7 billion.  

我曾以为自己很特别，是世界的中心。后来，我觉得自己什么都不是，只是 70 亿人中的一个。  

I’m still figuring it out. Am I unique, or just ordinary? Does it even matter?  

我还在想清楚这个问题。我是独特的，还是普通的？这重要吗？
